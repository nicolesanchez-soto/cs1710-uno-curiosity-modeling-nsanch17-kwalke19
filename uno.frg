/*  UNO is a multi-player card game where the goal is to be the first player   
    to get rid of all your cards. Players take turns playing cards from their  
    hand that match either the color or number of the card on top of the       
    discard pile. The game includes number cards (0-9) in four colors (red,    
    blue, green, yellow), as well as special action cards like Skip, Reverse,  
    and Draw Two that affect gameplay. Wild cards can be played at any time    
    and allow the player to choose a new color. Wild Draw Four cards combine   
    this color-changing ability with forcing the next player to draw four      
    cards. Players must call "UNO" when they have one card left or face a      
    penalty. The game continues until a player has successfully played all      
    their cards.
